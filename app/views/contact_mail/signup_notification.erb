Thank you, <%= @user %> for signing up to RAPodcast.net

Now, you may be asking yourself, "Self, what kind of benefits did I just get for signing up?"  A very good question indeed.  The truth is, not much as of yet.  But I'm (Dave) always tinkering with the site and adding bits of functionality here and there. So, you never know what a membership might one day give you.  
As it stands, when you, as a logged in user, suggest a link to us, YOUR username is going to be added to that link.  This may not sound exciting, but there are rumors abound of a listener competition, with possible prizes going to people who suggested the most links that we used in a show, or the most interesting link, or the most obscure, etc...
As always, the site is a work in progress.  More ideas come up and more functionality is implimented.  There is also talk about a user-based tagging system for the episodes, but I wouldn't get my hopes up quite yet. 

We hope that you enjoy listening to the podcast and we'd love to hear back from you.
You can contact us by emailing Dave at dpalay@rapodcast.net or Andy at qs23@rapodcast.net
